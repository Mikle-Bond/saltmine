# Saltmine
The world's simplest todo app

Add todos in an input field. They are kept in the browser tab's memory, when you close the tab they are gone. 
Click a task to make it "done" and it moves to the "Take credit for" column. Click a task that is already done to undo it again. 

That's it. Todos with no login, no tracking, and no persistence. 

## Dependencies
- Bootstrap via CDN (to make it pretty)
- VueJS via CDN (to make it work)
- jQuery (future proofing bootstrap stuff, there are dependencies but they are not really used. Maybe in the future? Just there becase the 
index file was a shameless copy-paste from getboostrap.com)

## How to use
- Clone it and use it as you wish
- Ready to use if you want it online: https://hakdo.github.io/saltmine.
